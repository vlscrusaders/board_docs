# ARTICLE VII. Association Funding

## Section 1. Funding Obligations

Every Member, Affiliate, and Associate congregation of the Association shall be obligated for and contribute its pro rata share of the Association’s annual budget requirements as recommended by the Board of Directors and ratified by the Delegate Assembly at its annual meeting, and, so far as practicably possible, shall pay the same at the rate of at least one-twelfth thereof each month until fully paid. The method of funding such financial obligations shall be determined by the individual Member, Affiliate, or Associate congregation.

## Section 2. Delinquencies

If a Member, Affiliate, or Associate congregation shall fail to pay its pro rata share of the Association’s annual budget requirements in full, during any fiscal year, the unpaid balance thereof shall be considered an obligation of such defaulting congregation to the extent that the congregation shall negotiate with the Board of Directors, for the purpose of arriving at a basis upon which the unpaid balance shall be resolved. If a Member, Affiliate or Associate congregation willfully fails to fulfill its obligations to the Association, its status, as such, at the recommendation of the Board of Directors and with approval of the Delegate Assembly, may be terminated

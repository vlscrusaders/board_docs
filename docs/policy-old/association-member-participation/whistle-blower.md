# Whistle Blower Policy

The whistleblower provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act provide additional whistleblower protections to individuals who report complaints about questionable accounting or auditing matters.  The Eastern Iowa Lutheran High School Association,(EILHSA) is committed to ensuring that an environment exists for employees to report suspected violations of the law or fraud.  The EILHSA has set up a mechanism to ensure that complaints are investigated in a timely manner and an employee bringing a complaint is free from retaliation.

The EILHSA is dedicated to the fair and accurate accounting of financial matters and expects all employees to act in accordance with the highest ethical standards in the performance of their duties on behalf of the EILHSA.  The EILHSA relies on all of its employees to abide by the intent and spirit of this policy and to report any suspected violations of this policy or other questionable financial, accounting or audit matters or potential legal violations of state and/or federal laws without fear of retaliation. 

The EILHSA has established the following procedures for the confidential, anonymous submissions of concerns or complaints by employees regarding questionable ethical, business, accounting, or auditing matters: 

## Filing a Complaint

Any employee who has complaints or concerns with respect to ethical behavior, accounting controls, auditing matters, violations of state or federal laws or policies of the EILHSA is strongly encouraged to report such a complaint or concern to a member of the Board of Directors.   

To file a complaint or concern to the Board of Directors, an individual should provide details in writing to the Chair of the Board of Directors or a member of the Board of Directors.

As many details as possible should be included with the complaint, such as a description of the questionable activity, the names of the individuals involved, the names of possible witnesses, dates, times, places, and any other available details.  The EILHSA encourages any employee to come forward with information.  Retaliation is prohibited against the individual bringing the complaint or concern to the Board of Directors.  However, any individual should feel free to report the complaint anonymously and confidentiality will be protected. 

Supervisors and managers who receive such complaints must consult with the Board of Directors prior to taking action.  The Board of Directors has the authority and responsibility for undertaking the investigation; the Board of Directors handles the complaints relating to ethical or accounting practices.

## Investigating a Complaint

The Board of Directors will oversee the intake and response to complaints.  The Board of Directors will fully evaluate and investigate the allegations of misconduct as expeditiously as possible.  Individuals should avoid making false statements and not engage in any activity that is either unlawful or unreasonable.  If the Board of Directors determines the complaint is outside the scope of the Board of Directorsâ€™ responsibility, it will refer the complaint to legal counsel for investigation. 

## Responding to a Complaint

Complaints will be addressed in a timely manner, and the individual bringing a complaint before the Board of Directors will receive a response.  The Board of Directors will maintain a record of all such complaints and concerns, along with the investigative outcomes, on a confidential basis.  Individuals bringing a complaint should in good faith participate in any subsequent procedures necessary to investigate the complaint.  At the conclusion of any investigation or proceeding, the outcome will be communicated to the individual bringing the complaint. 

## Ensuring a Non-Retaliation Policy

The EILHSA will not retaliate or take part in any form of reprisal against the individual bringing the complaint.  Any such retaliation is prohibited.  Employees who believe they may have been subject to retaliation should report such suspected retaliation to the Board of Directors in the same manner described above for the purpose of reporting questionable activity.

Any questions about this policy should be directed to the Chair of the Board of Directors.  Nothing in this policy pre-empts applicable state or federal statutes governing whistleblowers.

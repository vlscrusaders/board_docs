# Article III. - Doctrinal Standards

Valley Lutheran School accepts without reservation:

The members of the Eastern Iowa Lutheran High School Association unreservedly accept the canonical books of the Old and New Testaments of Holy Scripture to be the verbally inspired, inerrant Word of God and the sole rule and norm for all matters of faith and doctrine.

We also accept and acknowledge the Symbolical Books of the Evangelical Lutheran Church as contained in the Book of Concord of 1580 to be true and correct exposition of the Word of God. Therefore, in all matters pertaining to the Association and the school(s) operated by the Association, no doctrine shall be taught as truth nor any practice tolerated which are at variance with the Holy Scripture or the Symbols of the Evangelical Lutheran Church.

# Preamble

In Scripture our Lord commands His people to “*make disciples of all nations...teaching them everything I have commanded you*” ([Matthew 28:19-20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+28%3A19-20&version=ESV)). In response to this command, the Lutheran Church has established a long history of Christian education. In order to offer a quality education and to effectively teach the Christian faith to youth and children of all ages. 

:::tip "[Matthew 28:19-20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+28%3A19-20&version=ESV)"

    Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in[a] the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.

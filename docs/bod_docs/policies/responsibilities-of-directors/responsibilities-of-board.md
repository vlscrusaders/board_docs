# Responsibilties of the Board of Directors

1. The board is authorized to govern the schools of the Eastern Iowa Lutheran High School Association (Association). As the governing board of the Association’s schools, the board has four duties to perform: legislative duty, executive duty, evaluative duty, and reporting duty. 

2. As a representative of the Association members, the board is responsible for legislating policy for the Association’s schools. As a policy making body, the board has jurisdiction to enact policy with the force and effect of law for the management and operation of the Association’s schools. 

3. It is the responsibility of the board, under the board’s executive duty, to select its chief executive officer, the executive director, to operate the Association’s schools on the board’s behalf. The board delegates to the executive director its authority to carry out board policy, to formulate and carry out rules and regulations, and to handle the administrative details in a manner which supports and is consistent with board policy. 

4. The board has a responsibility to review the education program’s performance under its evaluative duty. The board regularly reviews the education program and ancillary services. The review includes a careful study and examination of the facts, conditions and circumstances surrounding the amount of funds received or expended and the education program’s ability to achieve the board’s educational philosophy for the Association schools. 

5. The board has the responsibility to make regular reports to the Delegate Assembly.

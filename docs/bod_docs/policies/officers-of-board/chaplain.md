# Chaplain to the Board of Directors

1. Chaplains are pastors of member congregations.

1. The duties of the chaplain are to remind the board of its Christian responsibility to include the Associationâ€™s mission, vision and beliefs in all of its deliberations and actions. The chaplain will be responsible for the opening devotion at each board meeting.

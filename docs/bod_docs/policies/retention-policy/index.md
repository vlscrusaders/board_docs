# Retention Policy

This policy outlines the specific provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in connection with records retention and provides a basic guideline to model in establishing and maintaining a functional records retention program.

## Document Retention/Destruction Policy

A document retention/destruction policy recites its purpose; provides retention guidelines and procedures for storage, organization, retrieval and destruction of documents; designates individuals responsible for ensuring compliance with the policy; and provides for the suspension of the policy in the event of litigation or an investigation.  In order to develop an effective records retention program, Eastern Iowa Lutheran High School Association ( EILHSA) undertake the following actions:  

Criteria and responsibilities of the Board of Directors are discussed below. 

1. Identify all pertinent records of the company, either in electronic or paper format. 

1. Identify all record retention requirements that are legally mandated.  Here, the expertise of legal counsel is merited to identify which documents are subject to governmental policy and have predetermined retention periods. 

1. Create appropriate retention and destruction schedules covering all relevant documents. 

1. Obtain proper management approvals prior to actual implementation of the record retention program. 

1. Perform effective day-to-day control and management of the records retention program.  

## Identifying Documents for Retention

1. In creating a document retention/destruction plan, EILHSA will abide by all laws governing its record retention requirements.  To accomplish this, the Board of Directors will list all categories of documents maintained within the EILHSA and assign retention/destruction schedule for documents under each categories. 

1. EILHSA has identified as many documents as possible, relevant to its business activities, which are subject to the document retention program. 

1. The Board of Directors will determine how long to keep each categories of all previously identified, pertinent document, and who is the contact primarily responsible for each category of documents within each department.  

1. The most important component of any document retention plan is the systematic disposal of the documents that have outlived their usefulness.  The formal policy, which is distributed to all employees should identify in addition to retention period for each document type, the manner of disposition for such documents upon the conclusion of the retention cycle.  Documents can be discarded from current document circulation in one of three ways â€“ recycled, shredded or archived.  Certain document items, i.e., financial and/or legal materials, should always be shredded should these materials reach a point of uselessness. 

The following are compliance guidelines that will be followed by implementing an electronic document retention policy:

1. Identify the committee member responsible for monitoring and purging electronic media.

1. The IT contact in collaboration with other committee members will create detailed logs of record-purging and back-up activities.

1. Archiving procedures will be periodically reviewed and tested.  If back-up tapes are used, be sure to initiate a plan for accessing data on old tapes.  Old back-up tapes should be organized and stored in a centrally located place within the organization or in an offsite storage facility.

1. Make certain that all media are considered and accounted for in the purging policy.  This includes, but is not limited to, servers, desktops, laptops, and various other portable media devices.

In the event that anyone within the organization receives notice regarding potential litigation, investigation, or audit, it is critical that he/she reports this information to the Board of Directors.  Following, immediate action should be taken to notify all affected persons within the organization not destroy any records until the Board of Directors determine what records are involved.  

## Documenting the Program

Having a comprehensive, legally sufficient records management program does little good if the organization cannot demonstrate that it maintained its records properly.  In such situations, governmental agencies and/or courts may assume that the organization did not adequately manage its records and may then issue sanctions.  Consequently, an organization must maintain appropriate documentation supporting the development and implementation of the program.  In this regard, (name of your organization) will:

1. Maintain documentation supporting the development of the overall records management program, specifically including the records retention program.

1. Write procedures, including the procedures in effect each year (rather than just the current procedures).

1. Write management approvals for the records management program.

1. Sign records retention schedules.

1. Document the destruction of records under a records retention program

1. Audit reports indicating compliance with the program
